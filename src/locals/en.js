      question: 'What’s special about PEX? Why should i bet on one?',
      answer: 'It allows parties to directly bet against each other without going through a central authority or bookmaker. This makes it 100% anonymous, no signs up no downloads required. The management of bets and the settlement of winnings are carried out collectively by the blockchain network, protecting users from any single point of failure. You can also create your own prediction markets.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need Ether? Does it support other cryptocurrencies?',
      answer: 'It allows parties to directly bet against each other without going through a central authority or bookmaker. This makes it 100% anonymous, no signs up no downloads required. The management of bets and the settlement of winnings are carried out collectively by the blockchain network, protecting users from any single point of failure.

        {
          title: 'Get Ether:',
          content: ' You can either buy ETH directly in PEX with your credit cards or from popular coin exchanges like Coinbase or Binance.',

        },
      ],
    },
    {
      question: 'What’s special about PEX? Why should i bet on one?',
      answer: 'Yes! When creating your own bet, you’ll enter the event you’re interested in and the outcome you want to bet on. Then, simply enter your stake and the odds you want. Then the PEX Engine will automatically find and match you with anyone that has an interest in the same event, and who accepts your odds.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do you police unsavory/illegal bets?',
      answer: 'We are currently building a system of checks and balances to flag up inappropriate behaviour in the dojo.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the system know the result of bets between people? Who acts as arbitrator and verifies one outcome vs. another at conclusion of contract?',
      answer: 'Ninja will soon have a completely decentralized solution for verifying the outcome and incentivizing truth telling (a DAO of reporters!). In the meantime, as we will launch just in time for the FIFA world cup, our team will use a public source (livescore.com) and act as the reporter.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Where is the coin held?',
      answer: 'No one holds the funds. All the funds are kept safe in escrow until a resolution is reached.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why should I bet on blockchain instead of using traditional methods?',
      answer: 'A decentralized prediction exchange will provide you the freedom to create your own odds and bet directly with anyone, offer you 100% ninja anonymity and guaranteed payouts.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How about privacy and anonymity?',
      answer: 'Ninja requires no downloads, and no sign ups. That means no passwords, no phone numbers and no emails. 100% anonymity.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to pay any fees?',
      answer: 'There are two main types of fees: creator fees (for the ninja that creates the bet) and the network fee (a percentage of the creator fee, that goes towards maintaining the platform).',
    },
    {
      question: 'What do I need to do when the outcome is finalized?',
      answer: 'Nothing. If you win, your winnings will be automatically transferred to your account. If you lose, it will be someone else’s account.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Where can I find a match to bet on?',
      answer: 'On the homepage, you’ll be able to browse ongoing bets and markets. If you can’t find any you like, create your own!',
    },
    {
      question: 'Other than sports, can I bet on anything else? How does it work?',
      answer: 'Very soon, Ninja will apply to everything under the sun. The only limitation will be your creativity. You can easily create any market on any future event, be it sports, politics, science, markets, climate… you name it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What’s gonna happen to the Handshake mobile app?',
      answer: 'We will be integrating Handshake (and your favourite features like promises, IOUs, contract upload, etc.) into the Ninja mobile website.',
